Project Overview:
The weather application is a Next.js-based web application designed to allow users to check the current weather conditions for a specified location. Leveraging the OpenWeatherMap API, the application dynamically fetches real-time weather data and presents it to the user in an intuitive and responsive interface.

Key Features:

    User-Friendly Interface: The application features a clean and user-friendly interface with three main pages - home, search, and details - ensuring a seamless navigation experience.

    Dynamic Routing: Implemented a dynamic routing system to facilitate navigation to the search page based on the user's input.

    Real-Time Weather Data: Connected to the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch and display current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief description, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information.

    Error Handling: Integrated basic error handling mechanisms to manage cases where users input invalid locations or encounter issues with API requests.

    Styling: Employed a basic styling approach for a visually appealing and responsive design.
